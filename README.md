# Shallow-Water

Shader code for shallow water equation referenced from:

https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xsd3DB
http://polycu.be/edit/?h=W2L7zN

And adapted to unity using CustomRenderTexture as a double buffer.

Amplify Shader Function is included to incorporate Shallow Water into other shaders. Requires Amplify Shader Editor to use of course.
